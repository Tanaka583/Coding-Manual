					  Welcome to Learning Javascript!
					     Javascript is another form of language for coding. Javascript helps code and activate the controls such as pulling down links and buttons. Without Javascript, the website would just be a still screen and apps such as games won't fuction. When you end a statement in Javascript, you add a semi-colon(;).When you click a button, it can generate to randomness. Radomness is a very esstential part in Javascript because if you are playing a running game like minions rush or subway surfers, you would want to restart the game differently or else it will be the same game over and over and the player would loose the interest in it. To read the code from a webpage, you can click right click and go to insert. There will be the code with the elements. If you make a webpage, you can click the inspect to check your code. There, you can check your mistakes. It is important to write the code with the write spelling, puctuations, and capitallizations in order to have have a correct, working code. I hope you learned some from this explanation for Javascript.
