					Who likes to have a fun paragraph? One way to style your paragraph is by changing the fonts, color, and background with jpeg and gifs! CSS is completely responsible for al these things! You can add style, color, and personalize it your own special way! In our website, the font, text size, text color, background color, and more, are all part of the CSS function and language! In a game like minecraft the block color and size are a few things that the CSS language and code could be responsible for! We hope you learned a few things about the language of CSS and we hope your now encouraged to use CSS alot!
